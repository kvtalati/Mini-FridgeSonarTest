**INTRODUCTION**

This repo is for our senior project. We followed a starting template based on this video https://youtu.be/Xb-HxFGayfY?si=Gf27hrvzK3ZNZbpi 
Two sample screens have been created, so everything will run out of the box. Also a number of useful scripts have been created in the package.json that allow the ability to run, build, test, lint and serve the application.


**FOLDER STRUCTURE**

- `src`: The main directory of the application.

  - `app`: Folder based routing directory.

  - `assets`: Images, fonts, sounds, etc.

  - `components`: Reusable React components.

  - `config`: Shared configuration values.

  - `hooks`: Reusable hooks.

  - `types`: Global and local typings.

  - `utils`: Helpers and reusable methods.
